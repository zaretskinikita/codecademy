# Data Science Foundations Project

For this project, we will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

We will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, we will analyze, clean up, and plot data.


Datasets were provided by Codecademy.com.
